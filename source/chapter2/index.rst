Components
==========

As previously stated React components are either functional or class based.

Class Based Components
----------------------

In order to use class based components one must first use the following syntax in order to import the component class
from React.

.. code-block:: javascript

    Import React, { Component } from 'react';

   :caption: React import statement.

Once that is done we can build a class based component.


.. code-block:: javascript

   class ClassComponent extends React.Component
