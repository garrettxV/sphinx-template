Intro to React
==============

React is a JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces. React is component based and each component
manages it's own state (more on state later). Components are used in conjunction with one another to create complex
user interfaces. Components can be functional components, or class based components. Functional components are considered
to be stateless components whereas class based components are stateful components.
